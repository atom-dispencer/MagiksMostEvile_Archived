INFO ON >>>    https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utilities/recipes/

>>> FORGE WILL LOAD ANY RECIPES FROM ./assets/<modid>/recipes/  ----- THEY MUST HAVE THE .json EXTENSION!

>>> ONE RECIPE PER JSON!!!

>>> PLEASE READ THE WEBPAGE FOR INFOS ON "FACTORIES" AND "CONSTANTS"

>>> IMPORTANT! FURNACES DO NOT USE JSONs FOR THEIR RECIPES! THEY USE: GameRegistry.addSmelting(input, output, exp);

"Type" refers to the kind of crafting recipe >>>  minecraft:crafting_shaped     OR     minecraft:crafting_shapeless
Shaped recipes require the "pattern" and "key" keywords. They might also have a 'data' field if you require the item to be, for example, on full durability.
Shapeless ones only need "ingredients"

Optionally you can add a "group" which refers to where it will be displayed in the crafting recipe helper
"Pattern" is the pattern of items in the shaped crafting recipe

Every recipe needs a "result".
Similarly to above you can add a "data" tag, however ONLY under "result" you can add a "count" if you want the recipe to produce more than one item.
